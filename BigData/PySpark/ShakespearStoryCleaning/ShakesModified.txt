oft thee muse

every alien pen hath got use
thee poesy disperse
thine taught dumb high sing
heavy ignorance aloft fly
added wing
given grace double majesty
yet compile
whose influence thine born thee

high learning rude ignorance
whilst alone call upon thy aid

thy great gift upon misprision growing

thus thee dream flatter
